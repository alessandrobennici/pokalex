# Pokalex ‚≠ê

### Hi there, welcome to my very first GitHub project!üåà
<br />

This is my interpretation of a Pok√©dex.

I used to watch Pok√©mons when I was younger - *I remember hating on Team Rocket with my whole soulü§¨* - but I never really dived into it.. don't judge me üíÄ
<br />
<br />

Now that I cleared my low knowledge of the Pok√©mons World - *and now that you know that there's a chance that you will find senseless things due to it* - let's have a look at what you can do in my Pokalex.

### What you can do
‚úÖ View a list of all Pok√©mons, including some base informations (such as weight, height, type and if you have actually caught that Pok√©mon).<br>
‚úÖ Filter this list by all, caught or uncaught Pok√©mons.<br>
‚úÖ Search a Pok√©mon by its name.<br>
‚úÖ View a detail page for each Pok√©mon.<br>
‚úÖ Catch/Release a Pok√©mon in the detail page (based on a random outcome).
<br>
<br>
